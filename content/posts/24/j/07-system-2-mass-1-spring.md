System of two mass and one spring<!--more-->

Two frictionless and free moving masses connected by a spring will have two natural frequencies, where one is zero [^centauri_2016]. The system can be considered as similar system with two springs [^hallauer_2022], but with the second spring is unattached to a fix point. Simpler system with only one mass but with massful spring is still interesting [^cushing_1984].
