Discussion triggered book searching<!--more-->

An information with age of about 3 hours listed in Google SERP showing the 2024 Nobel Prize lauretes [^nobel_2024]. The searching is triggered by discussion among Andriyan Bayu Suksmono, Acep Purqon, Faizal Rohmat, and others in several WhatsApp groups. It makes me itchy since I just know that development of ML is related to statistical physics. Dr. Purqon show a chapter with title "Chapter 8 Recurrent Networks Rooted in Statistical Physics", that I can not find the book. But I arrive at other book [^huang_2021], which I will put in my, not actually a real, TBR (to be read) list [^basmo_2023]. I have also acrylic elasticity experiment report [^angeli_2024], which should be also in the TBR.

Next day, in very early moring, about quarter to three, Suksmono send the link to Hopfield paper [^hopfield_1982], that has amazing citations, which are about 27879.
