5. Create a new Hugo site.
    ```

    Congratulations! Your new Hugo site was created in M:\bug2.

    Just a few more steps...

    1. Change the current directory to M:\bug2.
    2. Create or install a theme:
       - Create a new theme with the command "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>"
       - Install a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/
    3. Edit hugo.toml, setting the "theme" property to the theme name.
    4. Create new content with the command "hugo new content <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
    5. Start the embedded web server with the command "hugo server --buildDrafts".

    See documentation at https://gohugo.io/.
    ```
6. Change active directory to the newly created folder.
    ```
    $ cd bug2
    ```
7. Create a new theme
    ```
    $ hugo new theme default
    Creating new theme in M:\bug2\themes\default
    ```
8. Edit `hugo.toml` as follow.
    ```
    baseURL = 'https://dudung.github.io/bug2'
    languageCode = 'en-us'
    title = 'bug 2'
    theme = 'default'

    enableEmoji = true

    ignoreErrors = ['error-missing-instagram-accesstoken']

    [taxonomies]
      author = "authors"
      tag = "tags"
      category = "categories"

    [[menu.main]]
      name = 'Home'
      weight = 1
      identifier = 'home'
      url = '/'
    ```
9. Create a new post.
    ```
    $ hugo new posts/00/first-post-again.md
    Content "M:\\bug2\\content\\posts\\00\\first-post-again.md" created
    ```
10. Edit the post, which is this one.
11. Remove sample posts in newly created theme.
    ```
    $ rm themes/default/content -r
    ```
12. Create `footer.html` file.
    ```
    $ mkdir layouts/partials

    $ cp themes/default/layouts/partials/footer.html layouts/partials
    ```
13. Edit the file.
    ```
