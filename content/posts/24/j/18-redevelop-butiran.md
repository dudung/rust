Evaluate butiran and redevelop it again with additional force representing surface tension.

<!--more-->

The library butiran has been developed, first in JavaScript [^viridi_2023a] and later in Python [^viridi_2022], but both are stucked. Now it is time to evaluate it and redevelop it with mix programming languange and other software. If still in JS put the code in CodePen might be considered [^viridi_2023b], since it is easier than hosted on GitHub.

Following are notes produced in redeveloping butiran. Some might not be really related, but necessary.

+ [Gravitational force](../24j19).
+ [Electric force](../24j20).
+ [Spring force](../24j21).

This page will serve as entry note in this site for other notes related to the project.
