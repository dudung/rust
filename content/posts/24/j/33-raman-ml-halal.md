Topic of a master thesis, that leads to a conference paper, which is about relation between Raman spectrum and halal.

<!--more-->

Raman spectrums of various pure animals fat, with help of machine learning, is used to identify components of a mixture of animals fat, where it starts as a master thesis [^wicaksono_2024a] and then it is advanced to a conference paper [^wicaksono_2024b], which can be accessed openly in some institutions [^ieeeopen_2024].
