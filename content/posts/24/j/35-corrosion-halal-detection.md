Initial discussion with a company about some possibillities for research collaboration.

<!--more-->

It narrows to two topics, which are Raman spectroscopy-based corrosion and halal detections. Es ist die Mitra Djamal AG. There might be related references, e.g. a review about monitoring for oil and gas under deposit corrotions [^sliem_2021], a review about corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete study using Raman spectroscopy [^mi_2023], and the use of Raman spectroscopy to obtain corrosion rate and corrosion product characterisation [^criado_2013]. There is also question how to use Raman spectroscopy in measuring molecular height, which is possible [^debye_1947].

Next step is to exchange information from university to industry about preparation of a proposal with next week deadline, end of Oct 2022. [`krd5g`](https://osf.io/krd5g)
