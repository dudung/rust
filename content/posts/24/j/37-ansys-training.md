A trainning on CFD with Ansys Workbench and Fluent GUI with FEA.

<!--more-->

It is a four days training using Ansys Workbench and the package is Fluids and Structures, where the application is Fluent and Static Structural. These terms might be inaccuate since I am still confuse about the packages and applications.
