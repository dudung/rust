There are many excuses not to write, and there are also many reasons to write.

<!--more-->

Sketch:

This morning I try to start again consistently to write but in more non-formal way, on pasir instead on Medium, since here there will be no readers, so I can feel safe from critism, which I still can handle. It sounds weak, isn't it? Yesterday afternoon a friend sent a video related to writing  [^suhendra_2024], which is later traced back to [^philosophy_2017], where the original source is also available [^peterson_2017] with a quote

> The best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write.

that means a lot to me. It is not related to the fact that I am part of working group whose task is to prepare Computational Thinking course for first year student in our university. And the question is: Can Computational Thinking also be taught in the same way of Critical Thinking? So it is not just essay, but certain essay that include the computational way in solving problems.

Let us back to critical thinking, where following paragraph

> Critical thinking is defined as the mental process of actively and skillfully perception, analysis, synthesis and evaluation of collected information through observation, experience and communication that leads to a decision for action. 

is a definition [^papathanasiou_2014] from other available definitions

It is now 0734 and I have already sat in the office after having breakfast with the one at Soto Boyolali [^boyolali_2024]. The place has good and comfortable atmosphere. Unfortunately, there are many muscle people lately due to nearby fitnes place, but not very sure about it. I am not against this, but can you imagine after fitnes without showering then visit a place to take a breakfast? So, I recommend to visit this place for breakfast during work days but not during the weekend days. 

My plan today is first start this note, which is on the way; second having breakfast just two of us, which is also accomplished; third attending morning session of professors oration at the West Hall in about less than 45 minutes; fourth attending celebrating party at Urban and Regional Planning department, where the time required to get to the fourth from the thirds is about 3 minutes walk for 240 m [^maps_2024].

It is 0800, have to accept nature call, and the notes is already 3 mins legnth. The stomach feels better and I am relieved from such discomfort condition. But there is small, tiny discomfort feel that I would like to remove before attending the nearest event. I do not whether I should just sat in the toilette room to wail the relieving process or trink much water to induce the process, or just to the West Hall and then get out when it comes? At least I have several things to write to this note. By the way, I am listing to Start Wars song played by 40 Finges. They are good, I can listen to it and stil concentrate to my work. Enya dan Kitaro make me have to listen to them, so I can not work properly. Jazz is better than them, but classic like Vivaldi also does not work. I do not know why I have selected types of music that I can hear while working. The time is 0815 and this note already has length of 4 minutes. I think I shold walk to the West Hall, since it is advisable to enter the hall before 0830. I pause the writing process of this note.

This $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is a quadratic equation. Not so related, but only for count of the words :pray:.

It is interesting to know that 2024 profesor oration books have been available as flibook at ITB Press [^itbpress_2024], which will give more benefit to the audiencea, especially people, that by any change, do not have opportunity or access to the orations.

Now the time is 1418, it rains, and this notes already has 5 minutes length.

RP, our vehicle, is on the way to pick up me and the youngest. It is driven by the one. It is now 1449 and already the time for $\frac35$ in a day. It is still too far from 6 minutes note for now. I have found something interesting to write, right. Take a break first. A small nature call or the big one? Just take a seat on the place, :smile:.

I think, I give up. It is now 1855 and I am at home. For today a 5 minutes note are already good. The next difficulty is the consistency to write at least one note a day. I hope this stage can be achieved.

The oldest served tea with glass and transparent teapot with four small tea cups from Japan, from one of my student.

Just close this note for today.

`17-nov-2024` `0438` I think the horizontal line `---` or `___` look not too good. Actually, I want to use three dots `$\dots$` in the center, but I can not find it. The use of separator will be considered later, since there is already some setion `Info`, `Sketch`, `Refs`, and `Tags` (automatically by the template).

Well, fortunately it is 6 minutes note now. Wow! :100: &check;
