Notes:

I am reading now a book (Thiel & Masters, 2014) and feeling lost. It does not mean that the reading material is not good, but the situation is in different level compared where I am now. As a college not-yet-a-professor I am facing very administrative routines that act like an energy sink. It absorb every enthusiasm, dream, imagination, passion, and others, you name it, that I have.

The illustration about the difference between globalization and technoloy is very good. I am now, according to the definition, persuing the path of more to globalization instead of to technoloy.

The fact that startups require customers to be success holds my tounge. I always think that if I can make something good and the others need it, that is. Well, unfortunately it is not just that.

In the book following sentences

> If your product requires advertising or sales people to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.

tell one of four big lessons learned by enterpreneurs stucked with Sillicon Valley from the dot-com crash. They four still guide business thinking today.
