00 | This daily note init   | 1 | {{< url "../24l49" "24l49" >}} | below
+ Note:
  - 00 starts at about 1928 due to unfit condition since yesterday.
    + Details related to these two days, today and yesterday, will be later archived.
    + Sick of using computer at home, prefer to reread Full Metal Achemist to take notes. Conistency is difficult to maintain.
